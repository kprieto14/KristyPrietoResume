          <h2>Background</h2>
          <div>
            I am currently in the process of switching careers by learning to code to start as a 
            Web Developer in the tech field. I started self-learning online about a year ago and 
            teaching myself some basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript for my Front-End skills. I have 
            been formally attending a Full Stack Web-Development bootcamp with Suncoast Developers Guild
            in order to further my studies and get serious about learning to code! I have so far 
            learned the basics and fundamentals of C# and SQL and look forward to learning more and
            honing in my skills.

            While I may be switching careers from a social service to a technology based one, my
            hope is that one day when I am proficient in coding, that I can still help people by 
            creating technology that will help people with and without disabilities have access to
            more technology that will improve their lives, such as creating communication and 
            learning programs. I also hope to help encourage and inspire other minorities to pursue
            careers in which they are not pre-dominantly represented in.
